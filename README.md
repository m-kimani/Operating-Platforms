# Draw It or Lose It

The Gaming Room is a software development company whose goal was to create a game called Draw It or Lose It. The client wanted a web-based game that supported multiple teams, each with multiple players, with unique team names, and only one instance of the game running at a time.

In developing this documentation, I explained the domain model, the function of each class, and how each class contributes to the overall program. I feel I did particularly well in creating a clear domain model, which helped me map out the classes, fields, and methods I would need when building the application.

The most helpful part of the process was designing the domain model and evaluating the design constraints. The domain model gave me a visual guide for how the system would be structured, while the constraints led me to use the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the game could exist. This decision directly supported the client’s requirement.

If I were to revise one part of my work, I would expand my explanation of the design constraints. While I covered the basics, I could have gone deeper into how different operating systems and architectural choices influenced the design. This would make my justification for the chosen solution stronger.

I interpreted the user’s needs by drawing from both the requirements and my own experience as a gamer. For example, I considered issues like slow loading and rendering, which can frustrate users. It is important to focus on user needs because they are the ones who will ultimately determine the success of the product.

When approaching the design, I started by understanding the client’s goals, then analyzing the software requirements. I created design constraints, built the domain model, and compared operating system options to find the best deployment solution. In the future, I would continue using domain models and design patterns, while also incorporating more user testing and performance considerations early in the design process to make sure the software aligns closely with user expectations.
